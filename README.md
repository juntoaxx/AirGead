# AirGead
Software Cs-210
This software was an assignment where I was tasked to collect data about an investment.
This included the intial amount, monthly deposit, interest rate, and number of years.
I solved the problem, I was able to create and utilize software to do all the math.
I could have handled the code more consise.
If i had used my objects better I could have simplifed the code.
My knowledge of the formating procedures in c++ is lacking. I used what worked for each instance and I should have reformated to the code to handle the 
formatting in a more standard way. 
Formating took up most of my time, it was hard to manipulate the format meathod to produce a standard look.
I used as many functions as i could to keep it simpler, C++ has the best functions, I found it easier to pass varibles.
I could run a function and then the result was passed much easier than other langauges.
This alone allowed my function to do only one task. Java, C# always seemed to hate it when i tried to pass varibles, leading to always 
having store and then retreive them, this always added to complexity of the function. 
Also, c++ allowed me to run airgead.cpp functions in the main.cpp with little error.
When i look at that code and debug it was easier to find my errors during debug.
